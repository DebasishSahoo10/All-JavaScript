# Event Propogation : Delegation - Bubbling - Capturing

1. What is Event Delegation?

: Attaching Event Listener to the parent element instead of Children element, but to perform that event based on the children element. While we are rendering many elements on our DOM with the same type of data and expects same kind of behaviour from their event, there we can attach one event to the parent instead of attaching a lot of events in terms of one event per children.
