1. How is a forEach statement different from a for statement?

: a For Loop can run without any array or iterable data type constrains. Suppose we have to send an alert to our user, multiple times, then we can use for loop, pass a alert function inside it. But a forEach is restricted to iterable data types as it is a prototype on that data type.

2. Class Object and Static Keyword

: The static keyword in a class object in JavaScript means that the property or method defined with it belongs to the class itself, not to any instance of the class. This means that you can access the static property or method without creating an object from the class. For example, if you have a class called Car with a static method called hello, you can call it as Car.hello(), but not as mycar.hello() where mycar is an object of the Car class. Static properties and methods are useful for creating utility functions or constants that are related to the class, but do not need to be replicated for each instance.

3. What snippet could you add to this code to print "food" to the console?

```js
class Animal {
  static belly = [];
  eat() {
    Animal.belly.push("food");
  }
}
let a = new Animal();
a.eat();
console.log(/* Snippet Here */); //Prints food
```

: Animal.belly[0]

4. How does a function create a closure?
   - It reloads the document whenever the value changes.
   - It returns a reference to a variable in its parent scope.
   - It completes execution without returning.
   - It copies a local variable to the global scope.

: It returns a reference to a variable in its parent scope.

5. What will be the output of following code?

11. When we are storing records, then which data type is more efficient? Object or Array?

  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;

console.log(auto instanceof Car);
// Expected output: true

// Expected output: true
```

  return function (y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}
var addFive = makeAdder(5);
console.log(addFive(3));
```

: Mainly Currying. But Currying is not possible without Closures. So yes Closures too.
