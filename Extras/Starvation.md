## Starvation

- Starvation in JavaScript, or in programming in general, refers to a situation where a thread or a process is perpetually denied necessary resources to process its work. This mainly happens in multi-threaded or concurrent environments, where resources must be shared among multiple threads or processes.

- In JavaScript, which is single-threaded, starvation might occur in a slightly different manner due to the nature of the event loop and asynchronous programming. For instance, if a certain callback function or promise is always being pushed back in the Callback/Microtask Queue because other callbacks or promises are constantly being added in front of it, that would be a form of starvation. This might happen when there are long-running tasks or operations that are hogging the Event Loop, preventing other operations from executing.

- Here is an example of how starvation could potentially happen in JavaScript:

```js
let i = 0;
function recursiveTimeout() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    i++;
    console.log("recursiveTimeout", i);
    recursiveTimeout();
  }, 100);
}

function regularInterval() {
  setInterval(() => {
    console.log("regularInterval", i);
  }, 1000);
}

recursiveTimeout();
regularInterval();
```

- In this example, the function `recursiveTimeout` keeps adding new tasks to the Event Queue every 100 milliseconds. These tasks are added at the end of the Event Queue. The function `regularInterval` is supposed to add a new task to the Event Queue every 1000 milliseconds. However, because `recursiveTimeout` keeps adding tasks more frequently, the tasks from `regularInterval` might be delayed or even never get a chance to run if the Event Queue is always filled with tasks from `recursiveTimeout`. This is a form of starvation.

- In general, to avoid starvation in JavaScript, it's important to write non-blocking code and to avoid long-running operations that can hog the Event Loop. Breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and using async/await or Promises can help ensure that all tasks have a fair chance to run.
