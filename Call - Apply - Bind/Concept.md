# Call - Apply - Bind

1. Implicit Binding vs. Explicit Binding vs. Windows Binding

(a) Implicit Binding means accessing a method of an object on that object only. It means the THIS keyword in this scenario will point to the method carrying object here.
(b) Explicit Binding means accessing values of an object through an external function through Function Borrowing ways like Call - Apply - Bind. Here THIS keyword will refer to the object we are passing as argument to these methods.
(c) and Window Binding means attaching a function to the global scope and running it on the properties of window object.
