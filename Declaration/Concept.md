# Var - Let - Const

1. Difference Between Var/Let/Const

(a) Scope : Var is either Global scoped or Functional Scoped. Both Let and Const are block scoped.
(b) Declaration without Initialization : Var and Let keywords accept that, but if it is declared with Const, then it has to be declared and initialised at once.
(c) Value Updation : Let and Var allows that, but Const doesn't.
(d) Re-declaration : Var can re-declared within the same scope but Let and Const can not re-declared within the same scope.
